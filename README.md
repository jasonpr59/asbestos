A toy OS, from scratch.

Goals and Non-Goals
-------------------

I have the following goal for this project.

  * Make an OS, "from scratch."  We'll see what "from scratch" ends up
    meaning!  (In 6.828, we implemented many parts of an OS, but it
    was not from scratch.)

The following are not goals for this project:

  * Design a "good" OS.  I intend to run this unstructured OS into the
    ground, first.  Only then might I consider "doing it right" and
    designing an OS.

  * Use other people's libraries wisely..  Making an OS from scratch
    is probably not a good idea.  I would make progress a lot faster
    if I used other people's libraries.  But, the from-scratch aspect
    is very important to me, so I'm declaring those libs to be
    off-limits.
